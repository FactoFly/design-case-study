# Case Study Brief: Invoice Details Page Redesign at Factofly

## Background
At Factofly, we're dedicated to creating a platform in order to make life as easy as possible for freelancers. We've identified an area for improvement: the clarity of payment timelines on the invoice details page. This case study serves to assess your UX/UI design skills in a real-world scenario pertinent to our current challenges.

## Challenge
Your objective is to redesign the invoice details page, enhancing the clarity of payment timelines. Factofly processes payments based on a daily bank check at 10 AM. Payments recorded before this time are paid the same day; those after are paid the next day.

## Key Points to Address
1. **Enhanced Payment Timeline Clarity:** Your design must make it clear whether a payment is processed the same day or the next.
2. **User-Centric Design:** The redesign should prioritize ease of use and intuitive navigation, especially for freelancers needing quick access to information.
3. **Creative Freedom:** Functionality is key, but creative and innovative design approaches are encouraged. Feel free to deviate from our existing design language.

## Deliverables
1. A mockup of the redesigned invoice details page.
2. A written rationale for your design choices, emphasizing the enhancement of payment timeline understanding.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. **Clarity of Payment Timeline:** Effectiveness of the design in communicating payment times.
2. **User Experience and Intuitiveness:** Usability and ease of understanding of the design.
3. **Creativity and Innovation in Visual Design:** Creativity and visual appeal of the design.
4. **Practicality and Feasibility:** Practicality and feasibility of implementing the proposed design.
