# Case Study Brief: Invoice Details Page Redesign at Factofly

## Background:
You're a UX/UI Designer at Factofly, a FinTech company building innovative invoice software for freelancers. A key issue identified is the lack of clarity regarding payment timelines on the invoice details page.

## Challenge:
Your task is to redesign the invoice details page to clearly communicate when freelancers will get paid. Factofly processes payments based on a daily bank account check at 10 AM. Payments entered before this cut-off are paid out the same day, while those entered after are paid the next day.

## Key Points to Address:

1. Enhanced Payment Timeline Clarity: Design a solution that makes it unmistakably clear if a payment will be processed the same day or the next day.
2. User-Centric Approach: The design should prioritize ease of use and intuitive understanding, catering to freelancers who need quick and straightforward answers.
3. Creative Freedom in Design: While functionality is paramount, you have the liberty to explore creative avenues in the visual design. Feel free to deviate from the existing design language and propose something fresh and engaging.

## Deliverables:

1. A mockup of your redesigned invoice details page.
2. A brief rationale for your design choices, particularly focusing on how they enhance understanding of the payment timeline.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Effectiveness in clarifying the payment timeline.
- User experience and intuitiveness of the design.
- Creativity and innovation in the visual design.
- Practicality and feasibility of the proposed design.
